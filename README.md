# Masters-Projects-Repo
This is my Master's in Computer Science Projects Repository.
This is a project of Apriori Algorithm in CIS 550 Intro to Algorithm class.
Using this project you can find minimum itemsets of given datasets, For example: 1000 datasets with having a 20 more or less itemsets number, after that this algorithm will find you an decent itemsets for an given datasets.

This algorithm will compare and give total itemsets at last in results.
