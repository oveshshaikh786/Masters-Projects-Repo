# Masters-Projects-Repo
This is my Master's in Computer Science Projects Repository. <br>
This is a project of Apriori Algorithm in CIS 550 Intro to Algorithm class. <br>
Using this project you can find minimum itemsets of given datasets, For example: 1000 datasets with having a 20 more or less itemsets number, after that this algorithm will find you an decent itemsets for an given datasets.<br>

This algorithm will compare and give total itemsets at last in results.
